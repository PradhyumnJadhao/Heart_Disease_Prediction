❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System


📖 Overview
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical parameters (such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure).

Unlike standard academic projects that stop at a Jupyter Notebook, this system implements a full pipeline: Data Cleaning → Model Benchmarking → Deployment. The final solution is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to get real-time risk assessments.


🚀 Key Features
Multi-Model Benchmarking: Implemented and compared 5 distinct algorithms to find the optimal model:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest Classifier

Decision Tree

XGBoost


Robust Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and applied StandardScaler to normalize clinical features.

Interactive UI: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for real-time inference.

Visualizations: Includes correlation heatmaps and performance graphs to interpret model behavior.
